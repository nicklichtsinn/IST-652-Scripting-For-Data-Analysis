Problem 1: Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list. Execute the function with at least 3 different lists of numbers.


Code:
# program to multiply all the numbers in a list
 
def multlist(list) :
     
    # Multiply elements one by one
    result = 1
    for num in list:
         result = num * result
    return result
     
# my lists
list1 = [7, 30, 2]
list2 = [5, 19, 4]
list3 = [3, -5, 8]
print(multlist(list1))
print(multlist(list2))
print(multlist(list3))


Output:
420
380
-120


Problem 2: Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
 Code:
def string_counter(string):
    d={"upper_case":0, "lower_case":0}
    for letter in string:
        if letter.isupper():
           d["upper_case"]+=1
        elif letter.islower():
           d["lower_case"]+=1
        else:
           pass
    print ("Original String: ", string)
    print ("Number of Upper case characters: ", d["upper_case"])
    print ("Number of Lower case Characters: ", d["lower_case"])


string_counter('The quick Brown Fox')
string_counter('I know It''s Not easy for You, but there''s Bound to be a Learning Curve.')


Output:
Original String:  The quick Brown Fox
Number of Upper case characters:  3
Number of Lower case Characters:  13
Original String:  I know Its Not easy for You, but theres Bound to be a Learning Curve.
Number of Upper case characters:  7
Number of Lower case Characters:  46
